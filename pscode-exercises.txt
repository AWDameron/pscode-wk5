// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Variable_one = input here
Variable_two = input here

Sum = Variable_one + Variable_two

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

numberInput = input here

if numberInput % 2 has remainder of 0,
 number is even
else
 number is odd


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

input 5 numbers as list NumberList
Average = AVG(numberList)
Min of numberList = minNum
Max of numberList = maxNum
ouptut "Average: " + Average
output "Minimum: " + minNum
output "Maximum: " + maxNum
